# Toronto Police Service Race Based Data Collection Policy

## Background

* Toronto Police Service (TPS) is gathering public input on a Race Based Data Collection policy [TPS website] (http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/race-based-data/)
* TPS policy is based on the requirements of the Ontario provincial Anti Racism Act of 2017 which mandated the collection of race-based data by police and other organizations. 
* For the Toronto Police Service, data collection started on January 1, 2020.


## Issues

1. TPS Race Based Data Collection policy as describe will cover physical interactions only, namely:
* Use of force
* Strip searches
2. TPS uses many otheer tecvhnology based forms of surveillance, including
* Cell p[hone mponitoring
* Video cameras
3. The current Race Based Data collection policy does  not cover the technology based means  of monitoring at all. Whether a police officer is identifiying someone 
* in person, or 
* by cellphone, or 
* by camera, or 
* by any other means.
The purposes are similar and therefore the policies applied, incuding Race Based Data collection, should be similar.
4. Previous TPS policies of **carding**, and disproportionate identification on Black individuals, led to  a number of Huam Rights complaints  and was  part of the reason for Provincial legislation.
Carding or identification of individuals is not only performed through physical interactions, but also through technology baseed methods.
5. other cities sivh as Lops Angeles and New York have active movemoents of community groups that have monitored and milited all forms of technology based surveillance of citizens.
