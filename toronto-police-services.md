# Toronto Police Service Race Based Data Collection Policy

## Background

* Toronto Police Service (TPS) is gathering public input on a Race Based Data Collection policy [TPS website] (http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/race-based-data/)
* TPS policy is based on the requirements of the Ontario provincial Anti Racism Act of 2017 which mandated the collection of race-based data by police and other organizations. 
* For the Toronto Police Service, data collection started on January 1, 2020.

## Personal Experience
This Summer, like many others I have attended a number of events supporting Black Lives Matter.  At one of these events, specifically the #WalkforRegis event that took place on July 25th, 2020, I  noticed an unmarked White police van parked close to the gathering.  The van followed the #WalkforRegis into High Park,  confirming that it was a van used by police for surveillance of people at the event. The van had specialized equipment additions that indicated a technology such as Stingray was being used for surveillance of attendees at the #WalkforRegis.  This was my most recent and direct experience of technology based police surveillance, particularly surveillance of a Black community led gathering in Toronto.

## Police Data Collection methods have historically involved Systemac Racism
Toronto Police Services have been critiqued and stopped its previous practice of "carding", also known as Field Information Report (FIR) or Community Inquiry Report (CIR). The main issue with carding was that it involved systematic racism, particularly anti-Black racism, where Black individuals were highly over represented in carding interactions.  Many police forces across Canada that have been critiqued for problematic carding practices have responded by sayign what they do is not "carding" its something else by a  [different name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding_(police_policy))

## Issues

1. TPS Race Based Data Collection policy as describe will cover physical interactions only, namely:
* Use of force
* Strip searches
2. TPS uses many otheer tecvhnology based forms of surveillance, including
* Cell phone monitoring
* Video cameras
3. The current Race Based Data collection policy does  not cover the technology based means  of monitoring at all. Whether a police officer is identifiying someone 
* in person, or 
* by cellphone, or 
* by camera, or 
* by any other means.
The purposes are similar and therefore the policies applied, incuding Race Based Data collection, should be similar.
4. Previous TPS policies of **carding**, and disproportionate identification on Black individuals, led to  a number of Huam Rights complaints  and was  part of the reason for Provincial legislation.
Carding or identification of individuals is not only performed through physical interactions, but also through technology baseed methods.
5. other cities sivh as Lops Angeles and New York have active movemoents of community groups that have monitored and milited all forms of technology based surveillance of citizens.
