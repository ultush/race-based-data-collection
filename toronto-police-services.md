# Toronto Police Service Race Based Data Collection Policy is stuck in Victorian England policing in the 1800s

## Summary
Toronto Police Service is implementing a Race Based Data Collection Policy. The policy application is limited to a very narrow range of activities. The narrow application of the Race Based Data Strategy does not cover technology based means of identification used by Toronto Police Service. By not including technology based identification, the policy will not serve its purpose of mitigating systematic racism. Technology based identification tends to reinforce and multiply systematic racism, particularly Anti-Black racism, and therefore needs to be limited and controlled under strict Race Based Data collection policies, if and when technology based identification tools are implemented at all.

## Background
* Toronto Police Service (TPS) is gathering public and community input on a Race Based Data Collection policy [TPS website](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/race-based-data/)
* TPS Race Based Data Collection policy is based on the requirements of the Ontario provincial Anti Racism Act of 2017 which mandated the collection of race-based data by police and other organizations. 
* For the Toronto Police Service, data collection started on January 1, 2020.

## Personal Experience
This Summer, like many others I have attended a number of events supporting Black Lives Matter. At one of these events, specifically the #WalkforRegis event that took place on July 25th, 2020, I noticed an unmarked White police van parked close to the gathering. The van followed the #WalkforRegis participants into High Park, but at a distance, confirming that it was a van used by police for surveillance of people at the event. The van had specialized equipment modifications that indicated a technology, such as Stingray, which collects cell phone data, was being used for surveillance of attendees at the #WalkforRegis. This was my most recent and direct experience of technology based police surveillance, particularly surveillance of a Black community led gathering in Toronto. This experience has made me additionally vigilant of police use of technology for identification of individuals.

## Police Data Collection methods have involved Systematic Racism
Toronto Police Services have been critiqued and stopped its previous practice of "carding" in 2014, described by TPS as [Field Information Report (FIR) or Community Inquiry Report (CIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding_(police_policy)). The main issue with carding was that it involved systematic racism, particularly anti-Black racism, where Black individuals were highly over represented in carding interactions. In 2019, Toronto Police Services halted the acquisition of technology ShotSpotter, and one of the primary concerns raised was [disproportional policing of racialized communities](https://ccla.org/ccla-urges-toronto-delay-purchase-gunshot-location-technology-shotspotter/). Most recently in 2020, TPS officers admitted to using the Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) [Clearview AI](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-police-clearview-ai-1.5462785). One of the critical issues with FRT is that it is racial biased and it is less accurate at recognizing darker faces compared to lighter faces, resulting in mis-identification of individuals.  Whether the "technology" used by a police officer is a pen and a paper form, sound recognizing hardware and software implemented in racialized communities, or facial recognition software used from a police officers desk, the common problem is the same, over policing of racialized communities and particularly Black individuals. From the examples described, the use of technology by police in individual identification is not new, and continues to be used in pilot projects and unpublicized experiments. Therefore excluding technology based individual identification methods from Race Based Data Collection Policies is an incomplete application of the policy.

## Specific Issues with TPS Race Based Data Collection Policy

1. TPS Race Based Data Collection policy as describe will cover physical interactions only, namely:
* Use of force
* Strip searches
2. TPS uses many other technology based forms of individual identification, including:
* Cell phone monitoring
* Video cameras
3. The current Race Based Data collection policy does not cover the technology based means of identifying individuals at all.  
* by cell phone, or 
* by camera, or 
* by any other means.

Applying the Race Based Data Collection Policies to a limited set of in person interactions is problematic at many levels. 

First, the limited application of the policy assumes that the issues with systematic racism are associated with in person interactions.  Since the provincial race based data collection legislation is intended to mitigate systematic racism, to provide race based data as one indicator of over policing of particular communities, it cannot be limited to in person interactions. Toronto in 2020 is not Victorian England in the 1800s and police interactions involving identification of individuals involves many more technologies than a pen and paper form. 

Second, the question should not be about identifying a limited set of specific processes to which the policy is applied, but a broader policy that should be used as a tool in providing indicators for over policing and targeting of particular communities. Police initiated carding practices was completely rejected by racialized communities in Toronto and elsewhere, but a more community engaged Race Based Data Collection Policy is being engaged by community members as it provides checks and balances and accountability of interactions between police and racialzed communities. Therefore lets ensure this accountability of the TPS to racialized communities applies to all forms of identification including technology based identification and not only a limited set of in person interactions. 

Third, the Race Based data collection policy should be used as a proactive lens to examine technology based identification tools **before** their implementation, to understand that implementing a particular identification technology will result in over policing of particular communities and reinforcement of systematic racism rather than mitigation. Experiences of racial bias, discrimination, and targeting of racialized communities from other jurisdictions indicates that the vast majority of these identification and surveillance technologies should not be implemented at all.
